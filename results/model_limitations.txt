========== Model Limitations and Considerations ==========

1. MODEL SIMPLICITY
   - Logistic regression assumes linear relationships between features
   - Cannot capture complex, non-linear patterns in build failures
   - May underperform on intricate failure scenarios

2. FEATURE LIMITATIONS
   - Only uses quantitative metrics (durations, resource usage)
   - Missing qualitative factors: code changes, developer experience,
     time of day, day of week
   - No git metadata or code complexity metrics included

3. TEMPORAL ASPECTS
   - Model does not account for seasonal patterns or trends over time
   - No concept of recent deployment history or change frequency
   - Rolling windows help but are limited to short-term patterns

4. CLASS IMBALANCE HANDLING
   - Dataset has moderate imbalance (60% success, 40% failure)
   - Current model treats both classes equally
   - In production, you might want to adjust for cost of false negatives

5. PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS
   - Model needs retraining as pipeline characteristics change
   - Performance may degrade over time (model drift)
   - Should be combined with rule-based alerting, not used alone
   - False negatives (missed failures) are particularly costly

6. RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS
   - Collect more diverse features (code metrics, historical patterns)
   - Experiment with more sophisticated algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Implement ensemble methods to combine multiple models
   - Add confidence scoring to predictions
   - Set up model monitoring and automated retraining pipelines

7. WHEN TO USE THIS MODEL
   - As a complement to existing monitoring, not a replacement
   - For prioritizing manual reviews of suspicious builds
   - To provide early warnings before build completion
   - As a baseline for more sophisticated solutions
